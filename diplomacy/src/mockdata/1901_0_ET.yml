      "In response to your previous message, no I don't think I can do that - I think France might be upset if I were to take Brest from him.
      We are currently planning on bouncing in the Channel. I know, it is a waste of a move, but otherwise he is just going to go for it."

      "Hey Alice! Good of you to drop me a line; even though we are far away and unlikely to interact directly until towards the end (assuming we
      both make it that far), I think we could at least offer each other advice. Whadya say? So to start off, I'll give you some advice: go get France!
