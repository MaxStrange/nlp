Salutations and Peace be with You 

Dear Sir,
it has come to our attention the great lapse in diplomatic correspondence between our great, prosperous nations. The delay is entirely ours and for that we express our sincerest apologies.

May the silver light of your crescent shine on for centuries to come.

Your friend,
England

We hope only for the mutual growth and prosperity of our two proud nations, so that someday our nations may meet and assist each other on the field of battle.
