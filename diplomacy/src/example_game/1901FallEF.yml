        at this time we cannot help you in the European mainland conquest.
        We are amassing our forces on the border and will crush our mutual enemy."

        I shall support your entry if you are able to get both Bel. and Hol.
        For return our council will ask for Bel."

        "Another invitation
        Bonjour from France,
        I have come here to propose another plan that I believe you will benefit from.
        I suggest you to take Denmark as I take Bel. and Hol. if I am well supplied.
        Hopefully this will strike an interest in you and believe that you will make the better decision.
        Au revoir"
