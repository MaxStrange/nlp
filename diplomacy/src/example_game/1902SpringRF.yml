        "I say Germany is the bigger threat. I will say keep some troops in Sweden since I haven't told England about our alliance and we won't want you to lose your land.
        If you can move the fleet from St. Petersburg into the Baltic Sea and then ship your army in Livonia into Berlin would be a great attack.
        Warsaw unit can move towards Silesia but I have a hunch that Germany is militarizing south, so that is your call.
        My next turn will be moving units north to take over Bel, and Hol."

        "I see that England isn't responding so we will not be able to have their help.
        We shall expect Germany and England had formed some kind of alliance that will hurt our plans, so be prepared and plan wisely."

        "Yes, but beware not to give it out too soon.
        We shall hit them with a blitz attack!"
