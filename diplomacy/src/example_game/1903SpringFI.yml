        "Austria is going to attack Bohemia without question. That would cut my support. You should help Bohemia move to Munich instead. That is more likely to succeed."

        "Awesome.

        About Bohemia... You should have Burgundy support Bohemia to Munich. Meanwhile, attack Ruhr with Belgium.

        Unless you want me to contact Russia about what I should do with Bohemia. That would be fine too. Up to you."
