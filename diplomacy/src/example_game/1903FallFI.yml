"Ya, Turkey should be defending against Russia, but I believe most people would be attacking Russia since they are huge now"

"Invasion of Ruhr
I am moving my troops into Ruhr and am asking for your support"

"After Russia
We should also prepare for war in the eastern front against Russia, Warsaw looks juicy and Vienna is also open for education.
Thoughts?"

"I am moving into Kiel next turn and would be great if you help my aggression."

"Plans?
Now I believe I will be attacking on the eastern front against Russia, they have become too big and ignorant,
it is time for them to understand what we are capable to do"

"It will be interesting to see what Russia does in regards to Austria.
Seems like Turkey should be dismantling him, but it isn't happening."

"Sounds good."

"Absolutely. Will do."

"Vive la France!
I am attacking Adriatic sea with my boat to cut his support.
I will support Tuscany to Venice with my troop in Rome. (So you should move Tuscany to Venice).
I would suggest moving Piedmont to Tyrolia, and I will support taht with Munich. From there, Austria will be yours.
I would suggest, along with the above orders, that you move Burgundy to Ruhr with support from Belgium (or the other way around). Munich will support you to Kiel next turn.
Fortunes are looking up for you, my French friend!"
