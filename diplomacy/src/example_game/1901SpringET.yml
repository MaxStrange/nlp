        Dear Sir,
        it has come to our attention the great lapse in diplomatic correspondence between our great, prosperous nations. The delay is entirely ours and for that we express our sincerest apologies.
        May the silver light of your crescent shine on for centuries to come.
        Your friend,
        England"
